# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis was to gain insight to kickstarter campaigns and some of thier successes and failures. Through advanced excel tools we hope to analyize trends to bolster the success of a future campaign.

### Purpose
Working with this data was to gain a base knowlage of working with large datasets as well as fundementals of programing languages. Many coding languages and their programs operate in similar way to excel and it's mathematic equastions. By using specific sets of variables we can have the program do most of the work for us. Through using these powerful tools we are able to help Louise make informed decisions to benefit her kickstarter campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
To perform analysis I started with filtering of data. This broke the data down into information that was more relevent for what we are looking at. In the case of Louise we are looking to have a successful campaign for a play. We split the category and subcategory coloumn so that we could further filter down to just plays. While filtering down the data we also continued to calculate the date through conversions and formulas. Through manipulating data in coloumns we can make determine things like success rate, lenght and effectiveness in a campaign and many more variables. Powerful pivot tables help us understand data at a glance and build charts that give us a visual picture. The most challenging thing was getting all the formulas to work. Sometimes a simple thing like counting your array wrong results in a wrong selection. In a file like this kickstater we have many different formats of data and depending on the formula we are trying to build a different data type than expected can ruin a formual. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We can conlude that March is the best time to start a kickstarter as there is a rise in success rate that tapers out around Septtember.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The more requested for a kickstarter the more likely it is to fail.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Using Pivot tables to create these graphs can prove challenging when trying to make sure you have the correct information on each axis. Through trial and error it becomes easier to understand what you need to place where to get the desired table that you can turn into a chart. The different filters can make it difficult pinpointing your data but if you get lost you can clear everything and start over. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The fail rate is doesnt flucuate much over the course of a year meaning no time is anymore likely to fail. There does appear to be a rise in success rates beging in March and tapering out in September. The earlier in the year a kickstarter is started for plays thte greater the rate of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the goal the easier it is to get funded and succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset is limited in the fact that there are outliers that scew the data. These cause certain formulas to not display properly as well making it harder to read data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could see if being spotlighted or a staff pick has anything to do with success rate. We could aslo open up plays to all plays not just plays in the US and see how that affects the data.
